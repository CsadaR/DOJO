# 1. OOP Fundamentals
## OOP termininology
```txt
## True
Methods encode behavior of an object and are represented by functions.
Attributes encode the state of an object and are represented by variables.
Encapsulation is a software design practice of bundling the data and the methods that operate on that data.

## False
`.columns` is an example of a method of a DataFrame object.
Object and class are different terms describing the same concept.
Object is an abstract template describing the general states and behaviors.
A programming language can be either object-oriented or procedural, but not both.
```

## Exploring object interface
```python
##
In: type(mystery)
Out: __main__.Employee

##
# Print the mystery employee's name
print(mystery.name)

# Print the mystery employee's salary
print(mystery.salary)

# Give the mystery employee a raise of $2500
mystery.give_raise(2500)

# Print the salary again
print(mystery.salary)
```

## Class anatomy: attributes and methods
```python

```

## Understanding class definitions
```python

```

## Create your first class
```python

```

## Using attributes in class definition
```python

```

## Class anatomy: the __init__ constructor
```python

```

## Correct use of __init__
```python

```

## Add a class constructor
```python

```

```python

```

## Class-level attributes
```python

```

## Changing class attributes
```python

```

## Alternative constructors
```python

```

## Class inheritance
```python

```

## Understanding inheritance
```python

```

## Create a subclass
```python

```

## Customizing functionality via inheritance
```python

```

## Method inheritance
```python

```

## Inheritance of class attributes
```python

```

## Customizing a DataFrame
```python

```




# 3. Integrating with Standard Python
## Operator overloading: comparison
```python

```

## Overloading equality
```python

```

## Checking class equality
```python

```

## Comparison and inheritance
```python

```

## Operator overloading: string representation
```python

```

## String formatting review
```python

```

## String representation of objects
```python

```

## Exceptions
```python

```

## Catching exceptions
```python

```

## Custom exceptions
```python

```

## Handling exception hierarchies
```python

```




# 4. Best Practices of Class Design
## Designing for inheritance and polymorphism
```python

```

## Polymorphic methods
```python

```

## Square and rectangle
```python

```

## Managing data access: private attributes
```python

```

## Attribute naming conventions
```python

```

## Using internal attributes
```python

```

## Properties
```python

```

## What do properties do?
```python

```

## Create and set properties
```python

```

## Read-only properties
```python

```

## Congratulations!
```python
