# 1. A Scalable Language
## What is Scala?
```scala
## True
Many of Scala's design decisions aimed to address criticisms of Java.
Scala source code is intended to be compiled to Java bytecode.
Scala is a general-purpose programming language.
Scala powers some of the world's largest websites, applications, and data engineering infrastructures.
Scala executable code runs on a Java virtual machine.

## False
Scala means "fudgesicle" in Swedish.
```

## Why use Scala?
```scala
## Scalable
