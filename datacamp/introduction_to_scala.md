# 1. A Scalable Language
## What is Scala?
```scala
## True
Many of Scala's design decisions aimed to address criticisms of Java.
Scala source code is intended to be compiled to Java bytecode.
Scala is a general-purpose programming language.
Scala powers some of the world's largest websites, applications, and data engineering infrastructures.
Scala executable code runs on a Java virtual machine.

## False
Scala means "fudgesicle" in Swedish.
```

## Why use Scala?
```scala
## Scalable
Lego
Scala
Farmers' market
Bazaar

## Not scalable
The Taj Mahl
Empire State Building
Cathedral
```

## What makes Scala scalable?
```scala
## Object-oriented
Every operation is a mtehotd call.
Every value is an object.

## Functional
Operations of a program should map input values to output values rather than change data in place.
Functions are first-class values.
```

## Scala is object-oriented
```scala
// lable?// Calculate the difference between 8 and 5
val difference = 8 - 5

// Print the difference
println(difference)
```

## Define immutable variables (val)
```scala
// Define immutable variables for clubs 2♣ through 4♣
val twoClubs: Int = 2
val threeClubs: Int = 3
val fourClubs: Int = 4
```

## Don't try to change me
```scala

```

## Mutable variables (var) and type inference
```scala

```

## Define mutable variables (var)
```scala

```

## You can change me
```scala

```

## Pros and cons of immutability
```scala

```



# 2. Workflows, Functions, Collections
## Scripts, applications, and real-world workflows
```scala

```

## Create and run a Scala script
```scala

```

## Benefits of compiled languages
```scala

```

## Functions
```scala

```

## What do functions do?
```scala

```

## Identify the body of a function
```scala

```

## Call a function
```scala

```

## Arrays
```scala

```

## Create and parameterize an array
```scala

```

## Initialize an array
```scala

```

## An array, all at once
```scala

```

## Updating arrays
```scala

```

## Lists
```scala

```

## Initialize and prepend to a list
```scala

```

## Initialize a list using cons and Nil
```scala

```

## Concatenate Lists
```scala

```



# 3. Type Systems, Control Structures, Style
## Scala's static type system
```scala

```

## Static typing vs. dynamic typing
```scala

```

## Pros and cons of static type systems
```scala

```

## Make decisions with if and else
```scala

```

## if and printing
```scala

```

## if expressions result in a value
```scala

```

## if and else inside of a function
```scala

```

## while and the imperative style
```scala

```

## A simple while loop
```scala

```

## Loop over a collection with while
```scala

```

## foreach and the functional style
```scala

```

## Is Scala purely a functional language?
```scala

```

## Converting while to foreach
```scala

```

## Signs of style
```scala

```

## The essence of Scala
```scala

```
