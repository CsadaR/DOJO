# 1. Introduction to Databricks
## Why pick a Lakehouse?
```
Which of the following is not a reason to implement a lakehouse architecture?

[ ]You want great performance for both BI and machine learning workloads.
[ ]You want a single architecture to support all of your data workloads.
[x]You want to store all of your data in a proprietory data format.
[ ]You want the most cost-effective architectural solution for your organization.
```

## Benefits of the Databricks Lakehouse
As part of your presentation to the CIO, you would like to list why you should want to switch to the lakehouse architecture. Which of the following are key benefits of the Databricks platform? Select all that apply.
```
[x]Built on open-source technologies
[x]Databricks can run on any major cloud provider.
[x]Databricks enables data teams to be more collaborative.
[ ]Only teams that heavily use Python will benefit from Databricks
[ ]Database administrators can separate their data warehousing workloads away from other languages and personas.
```

## Architectural Decisions
```
## Data Warehouse
Typically very expensive
Performant for structured data only

## Data Lake
Data becomes very messy
Sub-optimal performance for different workloads

## Lakehouse
Great performance across all workloads
Very cost-effective for any data workload
```

## Why Delta?
```
The benefits of storing data in the Delta Lake table format include:

1. Fully ACID-compliant transactions: Delta Lake provides support for ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions, which ensures data integrity and consistency even in the face of concurrent data updates and failures.
2. Unified batch and streaming data sources: Delta Lake is designed to handle both batch and streaming data sources, making it suitable for real-time data processing scenarios.
3. Time travel and table history: Delta Lake allows you to access and query previous versions of the data (table history) through time travel capabilities, which can be useful for auditing, data recovery, and analysis purposes.

So, the correct answers are:

[x]Fully ACID-compliant transactions
[x]Unified batch and streaming data sources
[ ]Rigid table schema limitations
[x]Time travel and table history
```

## Databricks for different personas
```
One of the concerns of your CIO is that your future data architecture must satisfy all the different teams who work with your company's data. While you feel confident that Databricks can, you want to provide a list that clearly outlines supported personas.
Which of the following is not a dedicated persona in the Databricks Lakehouse platform?

[ ]Data engineer
[x]Software developer
[ ]Data scientist
[ ]SQL analyst
```

## Capabilities for each data persona
```
## SQL analyst
Dashboards
SQL Editor
SQL Warehouses

## Data Engineer
Delta Live Tables

## Data Scientist
Model Registry
Model Serving
```

## Managing and adding users
```
As your organization starts to adopt Databricks more, you have deployed multiple different workspaces for your lines of business. Each workspace is designed for a particular team and should only have access to their respective datasets. Your CIO has expressed concerns about how you can control access to the underlying datasets and the workspaces themselves as adoptions grow. They have asked you how Databricks and your architecture address this concern.
Which of the following statements is true with regard to user access within a Databricks account?

[ ]There is no way to easily ensure that users are assigned to the correct workspace, and must assign users manually.
[x]You can automatically sync users from your IdP to your Databricks account and then assign them to the correct workspaces based on their line of business.
[ ]You can automatically sync users from your IdP to your Databricks workspaces with no configuration
[ ]You do not need to assign users to Databricks, and can just pull their access information from your IdP.

Note: This means that while Databricks supports automatic synchronization of users from your Identity Provider, there is still a requirement for configuration or manual intervention to ensure that users are assigned to the correct workspaces according to their specific roles or lines of business. This approach helps maintain secure and organized access control as your organization scales up its use of Databricks.
```

## Control Plane vs. Data Plane
```
As you deploy your Databricks workspaces, you ensure your security team has approved the platform. In particular, the security team is curious about what information Databricks has access to and what you control.
Which of the following is true regarding the relationship between the Databricks Control Plane and the customer Data Plane?

[ ]The Control Plane stores customer data and the Databricks application, and the Data Plane only stores data.
[x]User interactions with the Databricks platform exist within the Control Plane, and is responsible for tasks such as launching clusters and initiating jobs.
[ ]Databricks creates a duplicate copy of everything between the Control and Data Plane.
[x]The Data Plane is where customers store their data in the data lake, ensuring better data security.
```

## Configure your Databricks workspace
```
Databricks:
Set up Unity Catalog to govern data.
Add users and groups to the Databricks environment.
Create a starter cluster and SQL Warehouse for your users.

Cloud Service Provider (CSP):
Collect and store data from source systems.
Set up user security groups across cloud services.

NOTE: Databricks focuses mainly on setting up data management and analytical environments, while CSP involves the collection, storage, and security management of data.
```



# 2. Data Engineering
## Data Explorer capabilities
```
You are a data engineer working for the centralized IT department at Sierra Publishing. On a day-to-day basis, you will get a variety of requests from different parts of your organization regarding different datasets. Historically, you have explored data programmatically by reading in different datasets one at a time.
Which of the following will be the benefits of using the Data Explorer instead of your previous approach?

[x]Ability to see sample data for a particular table.
[x]See the lineage for your data assets.
[ ]Provides the code to query a specific table.
[x]Ability to share data with other users.
[ ]Ability to automatically clean your data.
```

## Setting up a notebook
```
[ ]Create a SQL notebook and require all code to be in SQL.
[x]Create a Python notebook for your data engineering pipelines, and use %sql in the cells for your data analysts.
[ ]Create a Python notebook and require all code to be in Python.
[ ]There is no way for you to create a setup that supports both languages.

NOTE: This approach allows you to write in Python, which is your primary language, and enables your data analysts to write SQL queries within the same notebook by using the `%sql` magic command. Databricks notebooks support multi-language capabilities, making it possible to use different programming languages within the same notebook. This setup fosters collaboration and ensures that both you and your data analyst team can work efficiently in your preferred languages within the same data asset.
```

## Cluster configurations
```
## Valid Cluster Configuration
Databricks Runtime: Valid. The Databricks Runtime is a crucial part of the cluster configuration, encompassing the Apache Spark cluster manager and optimized versions of Hadoop components.
Node instance types: Valid. You can choose the types of nodes (instances) to use in your cluster. Different instance types offer varying combinations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity, suitable for different workloads.
Auto termination time: Valid. This setting allows clusters to automatically terminate after a specified period of inactivity, which is an important feature for cost savings.
User access to cluster: Partially Valid. While there isn't a direct setting to control user access to a cluster, managing user permissions and access controls at the workspace level indirectly relates to cluster usage.

## Invalid Cluster Configuration
How fast workloads run on the cluster: Invalid. There's no direct option to set the "speed" of workload execution. However, the performance of workloads is indirectly influenced by various settings like node types and cluster size.
Cluster monthly budget: Invalid. Databricks doesnâ€™t have a direct feature to set a "monthly budget" for clusters. However, cost management tools can be used to track and limit expenses, though this falls under organizational management rather than being a part of cluster configuration.
```

## Data Engineering foundations in Databricks
```
[x]DataFrames already exist in both pandas and SQL: This is correct. DataFrames are a common data structure used in both pandas (a popular Python library for data manipulation) and SQL. Your team's familiarity with these tools will be an advantage when working with DataFrames in Databricks.
[ ]DataFrames are complex and difficult to work with: DataFrames are a powerful and flexible way to work with data, but they are not inherently complex or difficult to work with. In fact, they provide a structured and efficient way to perform data operations, and their syntax is often more intuitive than writing raw SQL queries or using lower-level Spark RDDs (Resilient Distributed Datasets). Your team should not be discouraged by the perception that DataFrames are overly complex.
[x]Databricks will create the DataFrame, regardless of the language you use in your programming: This is also correct. Databricks supports multiple programming languages like Python, Scala, and R. DataFrames can be created and manipulated using these languages, so your team can continue using their preferred language while working with DataFrames.
[ ]DataFrames only work when writing code in Python
