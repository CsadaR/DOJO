# 1. Python Data Structures and String Manipulation
## List methods
```python
# Remove fruits from basket2 that are present in basket1
for item in basket1:
    if item in basket2:
        basket2.remove(item)

print('Basket 1: ' + str(basket1))
print('Basket 2: ' + str(basket2))

# Transfer fruits from basket1 to basket2
while len(basket1) > len(basket2):
    item_to_transfer = basket1.pop()
    basket2.append(item_to_transfer)

print('Basket 1: ' + str(basket1))
print('Basket 2: ' + str(basket2))
