# 1. Basic Concepts of String Manipulation
## First day!
```python
# Find characters in movie variable
length_string = len(movie)

# Convert to string
to_string = str(length_string)

# Predefined variable
statement = "Number of characters in this review:"

# Concatenate strings and print result
print(statement, to_string)
```

## Artificial reviews
```python
# Select the first 32 characters of movie1
first_part = movie1[:32]

# Select from 43rd character to the end of movie1
last_part = movie1[42:]

# Select from 33rd to the 42nd character
middle_part = movie2[32:42]

# Print concatenation and movie2 variable
print(first_part+last_part+middle_part) 
print(movie2)
```

## Palindromes
```python
# Get the word
movie_title = movie[11:30]

# Obtain the palindrome
palindrome = movie_title[::-1]

# Print the word if it's a palindrome
if movie_title == palindrome:
	print(movie_title)
```

## String operations
