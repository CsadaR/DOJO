# 1. What is data engineering?
## Go with the flow
```txt
1. Data collection and storage
2. Data preparation
3. Exploration and visualization
4. Experimentation and prediction
```

## Not responsible
```txt
## Data engineering tasks
Optimizing the customers databases for analysis.
Ensuring corrupted, unreadable music tracks are removed and don't end up facing customers.
Gathering music consumption data from desktop and mobile sources.

## Not data engineering tasks
Building a visualization to understand listening patterns by city.
Running an experiment to identify the optimal search bar positioning in the app.
Based on their listening behavior, predict which songs customers are likely to enjoy.
