# Goal
- Create a TensorFlow training application and validate it locally
- Run your training job on a single worker instance in the cloud
- Run your training job as a distributed training job in the cloud
- Optimize your hyperparameters by using hyperparameter tuning
- Deploy a model to support prediction
- Request an online prediction and see the response
- Request a batch prediction
