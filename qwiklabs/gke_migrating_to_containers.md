# Goal
- Isolated - Applications have their own libraries; no conflicts will arise from different libraries in other applications
- Limited (limits on CPU/memory) - Applications may not hog resources from other applications
- Portable - The container contains everything it needs and is not tied to an OS or Cloud provider
- Lightweight - The kernel is shared, making it much smaller and faster than a full OS image
